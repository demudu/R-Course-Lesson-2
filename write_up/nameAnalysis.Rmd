# Introduction
I looked at how common my name, "Page", is in the United States population both by Year and Sex

# Results

## Prevalance by Year
Below is a plot for how the proportion of people with the name 'Page' (log base 10 transformation) has changed over time. Overall the trend is pretty flat.
```{r}
year.plot
```
To test if there is a significant effect of a year a linear model was built. Proportion of the population log base 10 transformed was the dependant variable

```{r}
year.lm
```

## Prevalance by Sex

# Conclusion
